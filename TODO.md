#TODO

- PWA performance, it takes time to load when opening, do we need to do anything with the service worker?
- Include author for the isbn search
- Order books by google published
- Hyperlinks on series and author to do look ups
- Title, author, series search bars so that you can do more exact searches


# Phase 2
- Save books when looking up to create a cache almost, how woudld we merge results with those from ar etc...
